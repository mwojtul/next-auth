Authentication Providers in **Auth.js** are services that can be used to sign a user in.

Auth.js comes with a set of built-in providers. You can find them [here](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth/tree/main/packages/core/src/providers). Each built-in provider has its own documentation page:

:::note
Auth.js supports any **2.x** and **OpenID Connect (OIDC)** compliant providers and has built-in support for the most popular services.

<ul>
  {Object.entries(require("../../../providers.json"))
    .filter(([key]) => !["email", "credentials"].includes(key))
    .sort(([, a], [, b]) => a.localeCompare(b))
    .map(([key, name]) => (
      <li key={key}>
        <a href={`/reference/oauth-providers/${key}`}>{name}</a>
      </li>
    ))}
</ul>
